// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

#!/bin/bash
# Script to multiply two numbers provided as arguments

# Check if exactly two arguments are provided
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 number1 number2"
  exit 1
fi

# Get the numbers from the arguments
num1=$1
num2=$2

# Perform the multiplication
product=$((num1 * num2))

# Output the result
echo "The product of $num1 and $num2 is: $product"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


echo "Enter the first number: "
read num1

echo "Enter the second number: "
read num2

# Perform the addition
sum=$((num1 + num2))

# Output the result
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"
